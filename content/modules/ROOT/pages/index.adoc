= ChatOps generative AI with LLM, RAG and data science pipelines

Welcome to this demonstration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on Red Hat OpenShift AI. This presenter-led demo shows how organizations build AI-powered chatbots with company-specific knowledge, eliminating expensive model retraining.

== What This Demo Covers

This demonstration focuses on three key areas:

**Business Outcomes:**

* 10× cost reduction compared to LLM retraining
* 70% reduction in customer support escalations
* Minutes (not weeks) to update AI knowledge bases
* Enterprise governance and security for production AI

**Technical Capabilities:**

* RAG architecture for grounding LLMs in proprietary data
* Automated data science pipelines for knowledge updates
* OpenShift AI platform for building production AI applications
* Dual workflows for admins and data scientists

**Live Demonstration:**

* End-to-end RAG implementation on OpenShift AI
* Automated quality validation and monitoring
* GitOps continuous delivery with Argo CD
* Production troubleshooting and best practices

== Demo Structure

This demo uses the **Know/Show methodology** designed for presenter-led demonstrations:

**Module 1: xref:01-overview.adoc[Overview]** (5-10 minutes)

Business challenges, RAG solution overview, and customer questions

**Module 2: xref:02-details.adoc[Technical Background]** (10-15 minutes)

RAG architecture deep dive and OpenShift AI integration

**Module 3: xref:03-module-01-intro.adoc[Demo Part 1: Understanding RAG]** (15-20 minutes)

Visual explanation of RAG components and business impact

**Module 4: xref:04-module-02-demo.adoc[Demo Part 2: Live Demonstration]** (30-40 minutes)

Environment setup, pipeline automation, and quality validation

**Module 5: xref:05-conclusion.adoc[Conclusion and Next Steps]** (10-15 minutes)

Business impact recap, ROI analysis, and customer success path

**Total demo time:** 70-100 minutes (adjust based on audience)

== Know/Show Methodology

Each demo module separates business context from technical demonstration:

**Know Sections** provide:

* Business challenges and value propositions
* Strategic insights for decision makers
* Why this technology matters to the organization

**Show Sections** provide:

* Step-by-step presenter instructions
* What to demonstrate and expected outcomes
* Talking points and objection handling

**Benefits:** Presenters understand business value before demonstrating features, enabling consistent messaging across different audiences and presentation styles.

== Target Audiences
